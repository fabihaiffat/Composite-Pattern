# Composite-Pattern
A composite pattern is used where we need to handle a  group of objects as a single entity 
in a similar way.  In terms of a tree structure, the composite pattern composes 
objects to represent part as well as the entire hierarchy.  This type of design pattern falls under structural pattern as this pattern produces a tree structure of group of objects.
